h1. BaseGenerators

BaseGenerators provides two generators:

h2. base_bootstrap

This generator copies all the templates and helper methods needed for the base_scaffold generator.

<pre>
  ruby script/generate base_bootstrap layout_name
</pre>


h2. base_scaffold

This generator provides a scaffold structure that implements "ajax":http://github.com/jquery/jquery/ "pagination":http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate, "search":http://github.com/binarylogic/searchlogic, and "base html style":http://github.com/pilu/web-app-theme. Most of the functionality is lay on top of standard ruby gems. I was not trying to reinvent the wheel, but to embrace our wonderful community. 

<pre>
  ruby script/generate base_scaffold Product name:string price:decimal notes:text enabled:boolean
</pre>

h2. PLUS: Easy bootstrap of your new app!

You can use my own rails template script to bootstrap your app (and of course, include base scaffold). Warning: Although it's base on other rails templates, it also includes my personal choices, so you may not agree with it. 

<pre>
rails -m http://github.com/lucasefe/base-generators/raw/master/rails_template.rb my_new_rails_app
</pre>
