h1. Using Generators On Rails 3

h2. Installation

Add this to your Gemfile:

<pre>
  gem "base-generators"
</pre>

and do a simple:

<pre>
  bundle install
</pre>

h2. Generators

I have chosen not to go with the older base_ prefix, because it is too generic. Instead, the new prefix is common, so you get the following two creatures. 

h3. common:layout

This generator copies all the templates and helper methods needed for the base_scaffold generator to work.

<pre>
  rails generate common:layout layout_name
</pre>

h3. common:scaffold

This generator provides a scaffold structure that implements "ajax":http://github.com/jquery/jquery/ "pagination":http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate, "search":http://github.com/binarylogic/searchlogic, and "base html style":http://github.com/pilu/web-app-theme. Most of the functionality is built with standard ruby gems. Clearly, I am not trying to reinvent the wheel, but to embrace our wonderful community. 

<pre>
  rails generate common:scaffold Product name:string price:decimal notes:text enabled:boolean
</pre>
